description: "This dataset is intended to supplement the main B1 datasets, which contains
  unsorted spike times, audio recordings, and audio spectrograms from a zebra finch
  songbird during natural vocal behavior. Neural activity was recorded using Neuropixels
  probes from premotor and motor nuclei. This dataset can be found at: https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001046\n
  \nThis supplementary dataset contains the unprocessed broadband recordings.\n\n
  As part of the FALCON challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The held-in-calib
  data includes many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON
  challenge. The held-in-minival data is a small subset of the held-in-calib data
  intended for FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, held-out-calib
  data are separate sessions of data from held-in-calib, but have much fewer trials,
  intended to be used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors
  if making use of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each
  dataset split is considered one \"subject\" by the DANDI repository; only data from
  one songbird is included."
